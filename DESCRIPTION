Description: Provide a procedure to select response variables and estimate regression coefficients simultaneously. It also provides the screening procedure based on the distance correlation, the solutions to the quadratic 0-1 programming problems by transferring to k-flipping optimization problems and to continuous quadratic programming problems, and the multi-test procedure including Benjamini-Hochberg and Bonferroni correction.
